Collection of toys for Apple Watch, stimulated by @twostraws 100 days of SwiftUI

Some doodles on the 100 days of SwiftUI course from Paul Hudson, @twostraws

Paul has no responsibility for my poor attempts here, but I got a lot of inspiration for these from his web site and videos.

Feel free to use any or all of this code, although I would really like some feedback on how it can be improved.

All of the apps can be made freestanding very easily. None of them depends on an iOS app.
